## Uuuuh. That's my second try to do something cool =]

I'm making this thing because it's one of the hardest problems in the game. You simply cant find anybody to play with. And on this website(if i finish it) you will be able to find homies.

I'd like to add some image or gif here but Im lazy fuck ðŸ™‚

Aaaaand right now there's actually not many things you can do with it. But im working on it(maybe)

If you have any dumb ideas and you would like to see them to be implemented OR you found some bug(whole project is one big bug tho).You can click [here](https://discord.gg/eZewrwVaBZ) and I will get your credit card info

Cya babe!
